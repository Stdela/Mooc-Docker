# Exercise 2.4
> Add redis to example backend.

Redis is used to speed up some operations. Backend uses a slow api to get information. You can test the slow api by requesting /ping?redis=true with curl. The frontend program has a button to test this.

Configure a redis container to cache information for the backend. Use the documentation if needed when configuring: https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/

The backend README should have all the information needed to connect.

When you've correctly configured the button will turn green.

Submit the docker-compose.yml
